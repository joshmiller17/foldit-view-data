RQs
How do players look at Foldit puzzles?
What information is valuable to players to solve a puzzle?

FILTERS
- OPTIONS error = 0
- RPRP_PUZZLE_RANKS is_valid = 1
- no data from intro levels (i.e. don't have an entry in the puzzle table)
- no data from beginner levels (names start with Beginner) -> see also puzzle categories

VIEW
Conceptually, a View has metadata (uid, is_expert, is_highscore, ...) and data (view options). Each data dimension is [0,1] normalized by the range of the raw data. Categorical view options are coded as dummy binary variables.


TODO
1. Convert data into something Orange can read in: http://www.sqlitetutorial.net/sqlite-tutorial/sqlite-export-csv/
-- 1b. Clean db; for example many ints are written as u'0'
-- 1c. Apply filters
-- 1d. How to deal with "None" data?
2. Apply an exploratory hierarchical agglomerative clustering to the entire dataset; visualize with Orange. -- When I tried to cluster with Orange, it ran out of memory
3. Descriptive statistics for the Views:
-- 3a. Overall
-- 3b. Clustered by puzzle type
-- 3c. Clustered by expert / non-expert (see definition of expert in #4)
4. View Sharing. Define similarity as Euclidian distance between Views, calculated per element so we can consider the similarity between two Views as a vector of distances. The within-cluster similarity is the average of similarities between a View and every other View in the cluster (O(n^2) time). For each cluster, for each dimension, can report mean, SD, kurtosis, skew, and a graph. Can report summary data as the sum of distances.
-- 4a. Define a high scoring View as one which is in the top 5% of Views for a particular puzzle. Define an expert as a player with at least X high scoring Views, where X is the smallest number that results in experts being fewer than 5% of the players (probably 1-3 Views).
-- 4b. On average, how similar is each player to themselves? What if puzzle type is accounted for?
-- 4c. On average, how similar are experts? How similar are they per puzzle type, and what is the centroid View?
-- 4d. On average, how similar are high scoring views? How similar are they per puzzle type, and what is the centroid View?
-- 4e. On average, how similar are players within a group? How similar are they per puzzle type, and what is the centroid View?
5. What view options are correlated with each other? Simply a correlation matrix of all data.
-- 5a. Split by expert / non-expert, then re-run
6. How often do players change their views? Within a player, report percentage as number of unique view option settings / total Views. Report with the count of total Views for context.
-- 6a. Split by expert / non-expert, then re-run
-- 6b. Split again by puzzle-type, then re-run
7. Can we predict metadata based on data? Train linear regression models on the View data, for either expertise or Best score. How accurate is the model? What weight parameters are learned?

OPTIONAL TODO
1. (Efficiency) Create a new column for is_highscore, default -1 (unknown). When calculating highscore, check if known and simply use that value. Else calculate and set to 1 (true) or 0 (false).
